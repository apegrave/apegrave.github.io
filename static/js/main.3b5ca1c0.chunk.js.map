Their representatives wanted to expand our audience on mobile applications.\n\nThe task was to create a website on which the user can quickly begin to solve his main problem - watching a football match.\n\nAfter receiving all the requirements, several concepts were suggested, from which the customer chose the most suitable option. Further, based on the selected concepts, in the process of developing the main screens.\n<img src=\"./images/nf_02.png\" />\nAlso, the area of my responsibility included the development of application design for the iOS client. After a successful presentation of the design of the application to the customer, it was decided to begin design development for the iPad.\n<img src=\"./images/nf_03.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/nf_04.png\"/>\nAfter that, my task was to finalize the design for the website and create design for the smart TV.\n<img src=\"./images/nf_05.png\"/>\nThis was my first big project, in which I take part as a UX/UI designer. Although much was not clear to me along the way - thanks to the excellent team that supported and trained along the way, I managed to meet the deadlines and make a successful product.\n</p>\n        <div id=\"down_margin\"></div>\n        </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n \nexport default nf;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n \nclass spbtv extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div id=\"up_margin\"></div>\n        <center><h1>SPB TV Russia</h1></center>\n        <p>\n        <h3>01. Overview</h3>\n        To improve the quality and more efficient development of the head platform, the company decided to create its own product. Together with the team, I was able to participate in its creation. Since time allowed - I proposed to approach the design process comprehensively and do research.\n        <div id=\"info\">\n          <center>\n          \n          <i><h4>\"Free online service for watching TV channels and movies in high quality.\"</h4></i>\n          <h5>from website</h5>\n          </center>\n        </div>\n        \n        <h3>02. Research</h3>\nFirst of all we decided to determine business and user goals for the project. Next, we identified our target audience (TA). It was important for us to collect the maximum amount of information.<br/><br/>\n<img src=\"./images/spbtv_01.png\"/>\n\n1. Age<br/>\n2. Gender<br/>\n3. Education<br/>\n4. How much they spend on paid TV channels?<br/>\n5. Occupation?<br/>\n6. How users spend their free time?<br/>\n7. What communication channel do they use to receive information more often?<br/>\n8. What platform do they use more often when watching TV?<br/>\n9. What time do they use our services more often?<br/>\n10. what is the lifestyle of our users<br/>\n11. What device they are using when watching TV (mobile/laptop/Smart TV)?<br/>\n12. What category of content our users like most?<br/>\n13. etc.<br/><br/>\n\nAfter that, we examined the competitors, what functionality they have, what they have, what we don’t have. Our marketers collected information on the functionality that we needed to have in our product. We also collected information from user reviews in our applications to understand what difficulties our users face.<br/><br/>\n\n        <h3>03. Process</h3>\nAfter we received all the possible information, we were able to understand who our target audience really is. After that, we started creating user persona. For each person, we identified the tasks-problems-solutions that he faces.We used the personas further in our joyrney  map. At this stage, we tried to identify errors in the logic, prioritize and improve our solutions.<br/>\n\n<img src=\"./images/spbtv_02.png\"/>\nAfter that, we gathered as a team and based on all of the above, started brainstorm. As a result, we have created a mind map.  After that, we put together a project scheme with the main pages which allowed us to work on wireframes.\n<img src=\"./images/spbtv_03.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/spbtv_04.png\"/>\n        <h3>04.

My task was to develop a design for the application for Windows Phone and Windows Tablet.\n        <img src=\"./images/amediateka_01.png\"/>\nSince at the time of work Amediateka had his own corporate identity - this slightly eased my task. I concentrated on creating a native UX for users.\n\nI spent some time exploring the principles, guidelines, and best practices for the Windows mobile platform. After that, together with the project manager, we collected all the functional requirements that should have been in the mobile application.\n\nInitially we decided to use the native elements of the platform (metro style, fonts, errors, icon style). Meanwhile, I really wanted to leave the Amediateka style - I planned to take it from the web (colors, composition, company elements) so that users who are using the service on the web do not have a dissonance when switching to the application.\n    <img src=\"./images/amediateka_02.png\"/>\nAfter defining the concept and general direction, sketches and low fidelity mockups were designed. When they were approved by the team and the customer, I began to work on the details and states screens. For better understanding of big picture I've also created scheme with user flow. This allowed team to see some issues and mistake in logic.\n<img src=\"./images/amediateka_03.png\"/>\n\nIn some cases, for a better understanding of how a particular state or functionality works - I had to make functional presentations. For this, I used After Effects. It was something new in the company, so it took some time for me to work on it. But It was totally worth it - me and managers could decide and play around with this and that to take a decision. It saved development time alot.\n<img src=\"./images/amediateka_04.png\"/>\nAfter the design for Windows Phone was presented and approved, I started working on Windows Tablet.\n<img src=\"./images/amediateka_05.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/amediateka_06.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/amediateka_07.png\"/>\nOf course, working as a team with managers and developers gave me great experience in understanding the processes of developing a mobile application. However, I was very interested to understand the concept of Metro adopted in Windows Phone.\n\n        </p>\n        <div id=\"down_margin\"></div>\n        </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n \nexport default amediateka;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n \nclass skemio extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div id=\"up_margin\"></div>\n        <center><h1>Skem.io</h1></center>\n        <p>\n        <img src=\"./images/skemio_01.png\"/>\n        \n\n        \n\n        The idea of ​​creating a platform for visual programming arose from a colleague for a long time. We discussed the prospects of such a project, how much they will be interesting to people. And after one of the discussions, we decided to try to create it!<br/><br/>\n\n\n        <iframe width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1CNeVVFcu4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/><br/>\n\nThe idea and programming was on the side of my colleague, I was responsible for creating the visual part and UX. The aim of the project was to create a tool for advanced users with which they could make their program / website. The idea was that there are a lot of site designers at the moment, but most often they are imprisoned for a certain framework and technology. We wanted to give the user a maximum of possibilities, both over the visual part and over the data.\n\n\nInitially, we chose the graphic design approach. A successful concept has been made. In general, everything worked, it was cool. But at some point, we realized that you won’t go far on this. There were some restrictions on the code. It was decided to move in a different direction.\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_02.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_03.png\"/>\nAfter about a year, the concept was approved and I started sketching and choosing a style for the platform. In parallel, a website was created on which we collected e-mails of users who were interested in our product. I was also actively engaged in promotion in social networks. I tried on myself in the role of a specialist in marketing :).\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_04.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_05.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_06.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_08.png\"/>\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, due to some circumstances, my colleague and I decided to postpone the project until the best time. Participating in a startup gave me a lot of experience in managing time, it showed that sometimes it is necessary to fulfill different roles and be more flexible. It was a very valuable experience!\n<img src=\"./images/skemio_07.png\"/>\n        </p>\n        <div id=\"down_margin\"></div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n \nexport default skemio;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n \nclass wispi extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div id=\"up_margin\"></div>\n        <center><h1>Wispi</h1></center>\n        <p>\n\n        <h3>01. Overview</h3>\n        <img src=\"./images/wispi_08.png\"/>\n        Since the application belongs to the B2C segment, a very important aspect is the external presentation of the application. Together with the UI, it was necessary to propose and implement the latest patterns and practices. Also, in the absence of corporate identity, it was necessary to define and propose solutions that would create a holistic view of the application as a product.\n\n\n\n        <div id=\"info\">\n          <center>\n          \n          <i><h4>\"Our aim is to connect and promote communication between Wispi users FREE where possible and offer users excellent alternatives to the current phone / communication operator.\"</h4></i>\n          <h5>from website</h5>\n          </center>\n        </div>\n        <img src=\"./images/wispi_09.png\"/>\n        <h3>02. Process</h3>\n        \n        Since I started work on the project not from scratch, I had to dive into the application with my head, to become an experienced user of this application. To do this, I studied all the screens and made a scheme of the main screens for further work, tried all the functions and wrote them down in a separate place. After that, I had a number of conversations with stakeholders to understand the target audience, company values ​​and applications, what they expect from the application, what goals the product pursues and what tasks the teams will focus on in the near future.<br/><br/>\n\n        After I began to develop an idea of ​​the product and my role in the project, I began to research. For starters, I studied direct and non-direct competitors in the market. After analysis, together with the team, we tried to find functions that we could use in our application. We also looked at user reviews, tried to find sore pain in the application and features.\n\n        <img src=\"./images/wispi_10.png\"/>\n        \n        <div id=\"info\">\n        <center><i><h4>\n        \"it is better to have a bad plan than no plan\"\n\n        </h4></i>\n        <h5>Garry Kasparov</h5>\n        </center>\n        </div>\n        \n         \n        Only after that I was able to understand what I would have to work with, what specific advantages it had, what pain points are in the application, what kind of TA we have, what goals and prospects we have. I collected all the information and shared it with stakeholders. This was done for 2 reasons:<br/><br/>\n        1. <b>Double Check</b> - it's always important for me to understand whether I made the right conclusions or not.<br/>\n        2. <b>Transparency</b> - working in a cross-functional, decentralized team forces you to take additional attention to keep things open and clear.<br/><br/>\n        \n        After that, together with the team including BA, CEO, CTO and managers, we drew up a plan of my work. This plan contained tasks for the short and long term goals of the project.\n        \n        <h3>03. Insights & Opportunities</h3>\n\n        In the course of my research, several opportunities and pain spots in the application were identified that we needed to pay special attention to. They were added to my work plan:\n\n        <img src=\"./images/wispi_11.png\"/>\n        \n        <h3>04. Workflow</h3> \n\n        The work was built on sprints, so usually my part of the work was done before the team members did it. Most often, I received technical documentation of the assignment, according to which I drew a diagram of interaction and screens by hand. This was followed by the creation of frameworks and interaction. After that, I showed to stakeholders, received feedback. Next, I polished screens and transitions, often created prototypes to check my theories. After completion, I presented the design for the development team and prepared the necessary assets.<br/><br/>\n\n        Upon completion of development, I performed design validation.\n        <img src=\"./images/wispi_12.png\"/>\n        <h3>05.

One of these tasks was to create animated gifts in the application. On the one hand, the task does not seem to be very difficult - just make a beautiful animation. Difficulties arise when you need to make an animation that meets the requirements of the platform, business objectives, and constraints.\n        <center>\n        <div id=\"unselect\">\n\n            <video width=\"380\" height=\"380\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" muted=\"muted\">\n                <source src=\"video/hearts-arrow.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'/>\n                <source src=\"video/hearts-arrow.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp9, vorbis\"'/>\n            </video>            \n            <video width=\"380\" height=\"380\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" muted=\"muted\">\n                <source src=\"video/elf.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'/>\n                <source src=\"video/elf.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp9, vorbis\"'/>\n            </video>\n            </div>\n            </center>\nI believe that the ability of a designer to work with different tools and be able to solve tasks is one of the most important skills of a product designer.\n\nAt the very beginning, we sat down with the developers and managers and thought about what gifts should be and what restrictions should be so that later there would be no problems.\n\nFor the presentation of the final picture and subsequent export, I used After Effects. Next, I exported all the data to json and compiled the final archive.<br/><br/>\n<img src=\"./images/tango_gifts_01.png\"/>\nAn important requirement for animated gifts was the size of the final archive. The most “lightweight” option was to create an animation with several pictures, and the animation itself should be implemented with 4 properties: position, rotation, transparency and scale. The most \"heavy\" option was to create frame-by-frame animation. Since in the requirements it was agreed to make an animation 30 frames per second, it is easy to calculate that if each frame of the animation weighs, for example, 50 kb, a 5 second clip will weigh approximately 7.3 megabytes. Keeping in mind that the animation of the gift is loaded by the client - these are very large numbers.\n<img src=\"./images/tango_gifts_02.png\"/>\n\nIn such a situation, it is necessary to maintain a balance and combine “lightweight” and “heavy” animation to achieve an acceptable result. For an important animated gift, we could afford to use \"heavy\" animation, and for less - \"lightweight\".<br/><br/>\n\nSometimes quite complex ideas (piercing, overflowing) can be achieved at a low price, if you look a little. Below is a 3D scan of how the animation of piercing the arrow of the cupid of hearts was made.\n<center>\n<div id=\"unselect\">\n\n<video width=\"375\" height=\"375\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" muted=\"muted\">\n    <source src=\"video/3d_gift.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'/>\n    <source src=\"video/3d_gift.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp9, vorbis\"'/>\n</video>            \n</div>\n</center>\n\nSometimes I had to use 3D max to realize ideas, in this case I created a 3D model, rendered it, then exported everything to After Effects.\n<center>\n<div id=\"unselect\">\n            <video width=\"380\" height=\"380\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" muted=\"muted\">\n                <source src=\"video/bugatti.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'/>\n                <source src=\"video/bugatti.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp9, vorbis\"'/>\n            </video>        \n            <video width=\"380\" height=\"380\" loop=\"loop\" autoplay=\"autoplay\" muted=\"muted\">\n                <source src=\"video/diamond.mp4\" type='video/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2\"'/>\n                <source src=\"video/diamond.webm\" type='video/webm; codecs=\"vp9, vorbis\"'/>\n            </video>   \n            </div>\n            </center>\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n \nexport default gifts;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\n \nclass sber extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div id=\"up_margin\"></div>\n        <center><h1>Тестовое задание</h1></center>\n        <p>\n        <h3>01. Обзор</h3>\n        Перед тем как приступить к работе я всегда выполняю изучение по теме. Это важно как для более объективного понимания задачи, так и для общего кругозора о сфере. Плюс немаловажный факт - никогда не знаешь, когда та или иная информация окажется важной\\ключевой\\определяющей особенно в таких комплексных темах на стыке технологий.<br/><br/>\n\n        Будучи сам водителем и почитав\\подумав по теме - понимаешь, что тема действительно колоссальная, затрагивает целые пласты наук: <br/>\n\n        1. Автопром - это автомобили в целом и непосредственно устройства управления - физические объекты и аппаратные возможности.<br/>\n        2. Человек и поведенческая психология его в динамике использования автомобилем - управление, реакции на внутренние и внешние сигналы, привычки, опыт вождение и т.п.<br/>\n        3. Технологии в разрезе возможностей применения - приложения, сервисы, мультимедия, датчики, синхронизация.<br/><br/>\n\n        В силу временных рамок погрузится достаточно глубоко не представлялось возможным, поэтому пришлось “пройтись по верхам”, вот некоторые статьи, которые хотелось бы отметить отдельно:<br/><br/>\n\n        <a href=\"https://vc.ru/design/74497-sozdanie-dizayna-yandeks-avto\">Яндекс Авто</a> - интересная статья, которая пролила свет на процесс работы и показала один из подходов к работе<br/>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@autoustwo/the-near-future-of-in-car-hmi-5b34a76fc7a\">HMI</a> - серия статей про HMI, с небольшим экскурсом в историю и проблемы, которые возникают при в работе<br/>\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02787.pdf\">Tesla</a> - минимализм в HMI (Tesla)\n\n\n        \n        <h3>02. Уточнение и установление границ задачи</h3>\n        На этом этапе важно понять рамки задачи и стараться не выходить из них. Еще раз прочтя задание можно провести анализ для выявления дополнительных условий и наблюдений.\n\n\n<img src=\"./images/sber/002.png\"/>\n\nВ процессе работы было стойкое ощущение нехватки информации для полного погружения в задачу, которая может получена из совершенно разных уголков продукта, например: техническая документация, аппаратные возможности, ЦА, бизнес задачи, метрики, предыдущий опыт, частые ошибки, отзывы и инсайты. Визуально это можно представить так.\n\n<img src=\"./images/sber/001.png\"/>\n\nНепосредственное взаимодействие происходит между 3 объектами, каждый из которых имеет элементы управления: человек, руль и ГУ. В рамках ТЗ необходимо определить границы возможностей каждого из объектов.<br/><br/>\n\n\n<b>Водитель</b> - так как водитель едет (основной фокус внимания на дороге) область возможностей взаимодействия с элементами управления для выполнения целевого действия сужается до голосовой команды, физическим взаимодействием рукой с тачскрином или комбинации двух.<br/>\n<b>Руль</b> - имеет кнопки на руке + кнопка вызова голосового ассистента. Можно сделать вывод, что водитель может взаимодействовать с рулем только руками для выполнения целевого действия. Элементы управления руля могут выступать в роли автономного управления или в связке с ГУ.<br/>\n<b>ГУ</b> - обладает бóльшим спектром возможностей чем руль. Взаимодействие с водителем возможно голосом (вызывается кодовым словом) и руками (управление через тачскрин)<br/><br/>\n\n\nДополнительные выводы\\предположения, которые можно сделать из ТЗ:<br/>\n<ul>\n\n<li>1. Меню ГУ должно иметь как минимум 4 категории на тачскрине:\n  <ol type=\"a\">\n    <li>Навигатор</li>\n    <li>Радио</li>\n    <li>Медиа</li>\n    <li>Голосовой ассистент</li>\n  </ol></li>\n  <li>2. Условие того, что водитель залогинен в стриминговом сервисе намекает, что стриминговый сервис является сторонним, поэтому доступ к управлению контентом внутри приложения через голосовое управление возможно будет ограничен. Т.е. выбрать голосом нужный плейлист будет невозможно.<br/>\n  </li><li>3. Кнопки управления на руле могут выполнять роль “дополнения” к тачкрину (подтверждение, скролл, выбор). Например: меню -> выбор медиа -> выбор категории “плейлисты” -> выбор плейлиста “русский рок”.<br/>\n  </li><li>4. Так как основная функция, которая выбрана по умолчанию - навигатор, стоит учитывать возможность выполнения целевого действия в режиме мультизадачности. Тут возможны вариаций в зависимости от аппаратных возможностей системы:<br/>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>разделение экрана на две рабочие зоны - навигатор и выбор плейлиста (split screen)</li>\n<li>“перекидывания” навигатора на приборную панель</li>\n<li>частичное перекрытие экрана навигатора выбором плейлиста (overlay)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\nНа вышеописанных данных, предположениях и выводах можно построить предварительную схему взаимодействия водителя для выполнения целевого действия.\n\n<img src=\"./images/sber/003.png\"/>\n\n<h3>03. Исследование</h3>\n\nВ рамках тестового задания создание прото персон кажется не совсем целесообразным, так как мы рассматриваем очень конкретный случай и мотивы с целями не очень важны -> задача определена. Тем не менее даже тут мне кажется важным рассмотреть несколько сценариев пользовательского поведения.<br/><br/>\n\nК рассмотрению я выбрал следующие сценарии:<br/>\n<ul>\n  <li>1. Водитель выполняет целевое действие через голосового помощника</li>\n  <li>2. Водитель выполняет целевое действие через тачскрин</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"./images/sber/004.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/sber/005.png\"/>\n\nКарта сервиса позволила подробнее взглянуть на пошаговый этап взаимодействия и выявить проблемные моменты и возможности улучшения. Далее я перешел к наброскам и эскизам.\n\n<h3>04. Дизайн скетчи</h3>\n\nТак как UI/UX сильно завязан на физические размеры устройства экрана (а так же размер и соотношение сторон) - сложно что-то предлагать более менее детальное. <br/><br/>\n\nПосле проведенного исследования и изучения тенденций в уже созданных устройствах - становится понятным, что помимо меню и основного экрана - необходимо дополнительный элемент, который будет “наезжать” или “выезжать” на экран для выполнения второстепенных задач без отрыва от выполнения главной задачи. <br/><br/>\n\n\n\nЛогика расположения меню на экране слева (для леворуких машин) обусловлена близостью для взаимодействия в первую очередь с водителем. По той же причине кажется логичным расположить второстепенное окно слева. \n\n<img src=\"./images/sber/006.png\"/>\n<img src=\"./images/sber/007.png\"/>\n\n</p>\n        <div id=\"down_margin\"></div>\n        </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n \nexport default sber;","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport {\n  Route,\n  NavLink,\n  BrowserRouter,\n  Switch\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Home from \"./Home\";\nimport about from \"./about\";\nimport nf from \"./nf\";\nimport spbtv from \"./spbtv\";\nimport amediateka from \"./amediateka\";\nimport skemio from \"./skemio\";\nimport wispi from \"./wispi\";\nimport gifts from \"./gifts\";\nimport sber from \"./sber\";\n\nclass Main extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <BrowserRouter basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}>\n        \n        <div id=\"main\">\n            <div class=\"header\">\n                <a href=\"/\"><div class=\"logo\"><h2>Anatoly Sidorov</h2></div></a>\n                <div class=\"menu\">\n                    <NavLink exact to=\"/\">Works</NavLink>&emsp;\n                    <NavLink to=\"/about\">About</NavLink>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"content\">\n            <Switch>\n                <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home}/>\n                <Route path=\"/about\" component={about}/>\n                <Route path=\"/amediateka\" component={amediateka}/>\n                <Route path=\"/nf\" component={nf}/>\n                <Route path=\"/spbtv\" component={spbtv}/>\n                <Route path=\"/skemio\" component={skemio}/>\n                <Route path=\"/wispi\" component={wispi}/>\n                <Route path=\"/gifts\" component={gifts}/>\n                <Route path=\"/sber\" component={sber}/>\n            </Switch>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n      </BrowserRouter>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Main;","import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport Main from \"./Main\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\n \nReactDOM.render(\n    \n  <Main/>, \n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);  "],"sourceRoot":""}
